# MouseGame
Mouse Training Game for Students to practice using a 3 button mouse!

## Gameplay
Different shapped objects move around the screen in all directions.  New shapes appear periodically.  The color of the shape determines which button you should use to click on the shape.  You get points for clicking on the shape with the correct button and lose points if you click with the **wrong** button.  
  
In the *draging* game, you will use the appropriate mouse button to **drag** the shape onto the Golden colored Circle (which is also moving around the screen!)
  
The UP and DOWN arrow keys on the keyboard adjust the game difficulty (how fast the objects move, literally the frameRate of the game) and you will earn **more** points for clicking on objects at the higher difficulties.  
  
Hit the SPACE bar to end the game and Save your Score to a json file in the Game directory. **I might ask you to submit these results for homework!**
